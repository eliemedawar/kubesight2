# Coordination log and merge protocol

Read `OWNERSHIP.md` first. This file is the shared working log — the only channel
the three agents have to each other. Each agent appends; nobody rewrites another
agent's entries.

## Merge protocol

1. Work on your own branch (`track/backend`, `track/frontend`, `track/platform`).
2. **Rebase on `master` daily.** Not weekly. Three cold-context agents diverge
   fast, and `frontend/src/App.jsx` is being rewritten continuously for the first
   month while the other two tracks add API surface.
3. Merge to `master` only when CI is green.
4. Run the `/verify` skill (launches KubeSight in mock mode, drives it with
   Playwright) before any merge that crosses the frontend/backend boundary. CI
   catches unit-level breakage; only `/verify` catches a frontend built against a
   backend contract that moved.
5. Never force-push `master`.

## Contract changes

Contracts in `CONTRACTS.md` are frozen. They are what the other tracks are
building against right now, without being able to see your code.

To change one:

1. Append a proposal to the Contract Changes section below — current shape,
   proposed shape, reason, affected tracks.
2. Wait for an explicit ack from every affected track in this file.
3. Only then edit `CONTRACTS.md` and implement.

A unilateral contract change is the failure mode that costs a week. If you are
blocked and cannot wait, build behind an adapter in your own code and file the
proposal anyway.

## Definition of done

A task is done when: code merged to `master`, CI green, tests added, and any
contract it touched reflected in `CONTRACTS.md`. Not before.

## Insertion requests

Requests for `backend/api/__init__.py` and `backend/api/routes/__init__.py`,
which only A1 edits. Format:

```
### [DATE] [TRACK] short description
File: backend/api/__init__.py
Where: inside create_app, after register_blueprints(app)
Add:
    from .x import y
    y(app)
Status: pending | applied
```
